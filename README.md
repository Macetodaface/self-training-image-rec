# self-training-image-rec

## Setup:

Check python version 3.7.6

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Running tutorial.py runs through a code tutorial of tensorflow for an image classifier for dogs and cats.


Running data/stl10_input.py will download the stl10 dataset and save it to disk.
It also contains various utils for loading the dataset in python.


Running Train.py will train a model using the train/test split for the stl10 dataset. Currently, it solves the binary classification problem between animal and machine.


## TODO
Save / load model to disk.

Incorporate data augmentation steps featured in tutorial.py to increase performance.

Implement self-training data augmentation.

Implement variable learning rate.
