# self-training-image-rec

##Setup:
Check python version 3.7.6

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

##Running
Tutorial.py runs through a code tutorial of tensorflow for an image classifier for dogs and cats.
There are several different steps for dataset  viewing, training, displaying results, and finally generating some additional training data that could be used when training.
At times
The code is a bit piece-wise but should serve as a good starting point for us to work from.
